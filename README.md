Welcome to the "Project Assignment: Solving the Pick-and-Place Environment in Robosuite" repository! This repository is intended to allow for the replication of our project results and documents its progress including insights as well as tests.

## Table of Contents
 This repository holds the source code framework for training and evaluating the policy in the pick-and-place environments as well as a configuration file to set the different robosuite modules (robots, controllers, etc.) and tune hyperparameters

## Project Description
### Course description
**[Innovative Konzepte zur Programmierung von Industrierobotern](https://ipr.iar.kit.edu/lehrangebote_3804.php)** is an interactive course at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, supervised by Prof. Bj√∂rn Hein, dealing with new methods of programming industrial robots. The topics covered in this lecture include collision-detection, collision-free path planning, path optimization and the emerging field of Reinforcement Learning. As the conclusion of the lecture, a final project related to one of these topics must be implemented by a team of two course participants.
### Task Description
Our team's task is to solve the **[Pick-and-Place Environment](https://robosuite.ai/docs/modules/environments.html#pick-and-place)** from Robosuite using Reinforcement Learning. In this simulated environment, a robot arm needs to place four objects from a bin into their designated container. At every initialization of the environment, the location of the objects are randomized and the task is considered successful is the robot arm manages to place every object into their corresponding container. 

#### Subtasks:
The task (for each object) can be subdivided into the following subtasks:

 1. Reaching: Move to nearest object
 2. Grasping: Pick up the object
 3. Lifting: Carry object to container
 4. Hovering: Drop object into corresponding container
 5. Repeat starting at 1. until all objects are placed in their corresponding containers

#### Reward function:
The reward function is essential to understanding the behaviour of the robot while interacting with the environment. In robosuite each environment has implemented two different kinds of reward functions. A binary reward rewards the robot only in the case if the object is placed in its corresponding container. We employed the dense reward function which uses reward shaping and rewards the robot for each subtask (like reaching & grasping), these rewards are then added successively. The image below taken from the [python code for the pick-and-place task](https://github.com/ARISE-Initiative/robosuite/blob/eafb81f54ffc104f905ee48a16bb15f059176ad3/robosuite/environments/manipulation/pick_place.py#L260) describes the additional rewards for each subtask:

## Installation

### Installing robosuite and stable baselines 3
Even though in theory employing robosuite on windows is possible (e.g. using a VM or WSL), it leads to complications, which is why using a linux or mac computer is highly recommended. Before being able to use our repository, you need to install robosuite following the [installation guide](https://robosuite.ai/docs/installation.html) from the robosuite documentation. We installed it from source:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ARISE-Initiative/robosuite.git
$ cd robosuite
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Our repository uses the stable release of the stable baselines 3 for RL algorithm implementations which you can install by following the [installation guide](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/install.html):

```
pip  install  stable-baselines3[extra]
```

### Installing our repository
On debian the non free cuda driver has to be installed as a kernel level module in order to use the GPU for calculations. This change resulted in crashes of wayland DSP so a X11 has to be used as a fallback.

Our code is writen for python3.11. The following python packages are needed: numpy (below version 2), robosuite, stable-baselines3[extra], libhdf5, h5py
```
pip install -e .
```

### Full installation (with extra envs and test dependencies)

```
apt-get install swig cmake ffmpeg
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .[plots,tests]
```

Please see [Stable Baselines3 documentation](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/) for alternatives to install stable baselines3.

## Train an Agent

The hyperparameters for each environment are defined in `hyperparameters/algo_name.yml`.

If the environment exists in this file, then you can train an agent using:
```
python train.py --algo algo_name --env env_id
```

Evaluate the agent every 10000 steps using 10 episodes for evaluation (using only one evaluation env):
```
python train.py --algo sac --env HalfCheetahBulletEnv-v0 --eval-freq 10000 --eval-episodes 10 --n-eval-envs 1
```

## Enjoy a Trained Agent

**Note: to download the repo with the trained agents, you must use `git clone --recursive https://github.com/DLR-RM/rl-baselines3-zoo`** in order to clone the submodule too.


If the trained agent exists, then you can see it in action using:
```
python enjoy.py --algo algo_name --env env_id
```

For example, enjoy A2C on Breakout during 5000 timesteps:
```
python enjoy.py --algo a2c --env BreakoutNoFrameskip-v4 --folder rl-trained-agents/ -n 5000
```

## Hyperparameters Tuning

Please see the [dedicated section](https://rl-baselines3-zoo.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/tuning.html) of the documentation.
